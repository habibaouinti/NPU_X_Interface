# Neural-Processing-Unit
This project's aim is the implement a neural processing tile that can be integrated into
a RISC- V based SoC architecture. The neural tile will be controlled by a RISC-V core
through custom instructions as a co-processor unit. It should also have access to memory
and SoC peripherals. The focus of the work will be around the implementation of a
programmable neural processing tile to support several convolution operations as well as
the interfacing with the RISC-V core and data management between the neural tile and
RISC-V SoC memory. The neural tile implementation has to be developed using RTL
targeting Xilinx FPGA devices.
